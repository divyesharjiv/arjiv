      "A single cut on the other hand is a simple form of cutting a round diamond with only 17 or 18 facets. If you compare a Single Cut Diamond (usually small Carat Weights of 1.2mm or less) , to a Full Cut Diamond (58 facets), you’d quickly see the difference. Small high quality single cut diamonds are highly prized especially in the watch industry, and because there are fewer but larger facets, they give off a majestic dance of light and colour, that is often lost in a sea of white light with the full cut stones",
